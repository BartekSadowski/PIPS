# Make art in R
 

## Description

`make_art()` allows you to generate some random art in R. You can either choose one out of four art types or fully rely on fate.

## Sourcing

To use `make_art()` simply source it from my github:

```{r source}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BartekSadowski/PIPS/main/functions_assignment_3_2R.R")
```

## Usage

```{r make_art, eval=FALSE}
make_art(seed, art_type = "random", outer_canvas = 1000, inner_canvas = outer_canvas)
```

## Arguments

<div style = "text-align: justify;">
|   |   |
|---|---|
|`seed`   |You can optionally specify a random seed to make your art reproducible. By default no value of the random seed is prespecified. See `?set.seed` for more information.  |
|`art_type`   |There are four kinds of art possible to generate. You can either prespecify what kind od art you want to generate by setting `art_type` to a relevant string or let the algorithm to choose it for you. More in details.   |
|`outer_canvas`   |All art generated by `make_art()` comes in the format of a square. You can, however, choose the length of the edge of that square (in pixels) by assigning a number to `outer_canvas`. By default `outer_canvas = 1000`   |
|`inner_canvas` |However, you do not have to use the whole generated square a.k.a. canvas for your art. The art can be generated centrally on a smaller part of the canvas. You can specify the length of the edge of the square within the whole canvas that is devoted to painting. The rest of the canvas will stay blank. Remember that `inner_canvas` has to be smaller or equal then `outer_canvas`. By default `inner_canvas` equals to `outer_canvas`

## Details

<div style = "text-align: justify;">
`make_art()` produces four kinds of art: `"lines"`, `"angles"`, `"squares"` and `"patches"`. If you want to generate any particular kind of art, specify it as the `art_type` argument. If you do not assign any value or you assign a different value then one of the four listed above, `make_art()` will draw a type of art for you.

`"lines"`gives you an image of horizontal stripes of different hues from a randomly generated gradient of colours. `"angles"` creates something similar to `"lines"` but some of the stripes are vertical there and they meet with horizontal ones in a way that resembles a right angle.

`"squares"` gives you an image created of smaller, colourful squares organized in a grid. The size and number of squares as well as their colours are randomly determined. Moreover, half of the time the generated squares will be rotated by a random angle. To achieve the best effect of this kind of art, it is recommended to set smaller `inner_canvas` relative to `outer_canvas`.

`"patches"` gives you an image created by series of colourful patches of the common pattern that are randomly located across the canvas. As the location, their size, amount and colours are determined randomly.

Note that some kinds of art might render slightly longer then others.

## Examples

See several usage demonstrations of `make_art()`. Note that `make_art()` displays images in a new window. The images here are embedded in the file only for the illustration.

An art generated without any arguments specified:
```{r no_args, eval=FALSE}
make_art()
```

However, the code above always generates a different image. If you want your art to be reproducible, set seed:
```{r seed, eval=FALSE}
make_art(seed = 1234)
```
![](https://github.com/BartekSadowski/PIPS/blob/main/Pictures/example2.png?raw=true)

If you know to generate any image of the `"lines"` kind, specify `art_type`:
```{r lines, eval=FALSE}
make_art(art_type = "lines")
```
![](https://github.com/BartekSadowski/PIPS/blob/main/Pictures/example3.png?raw=true)

Suppose now, that you want the `"angles"` art type created on a canvas with the edge length of 100 pixels:
```{r angles, eval=FALSE}
make_art(art_type = "angles", outer_canvas = 100)
```
![](https://github.com/BartekSadowski/PIPS/blob/main/Pictures/example4.png?raw=true)

Now suppose, that you want to generate `"squares"` on the default `outer_canvas` but with `inner_canvas` set to 500 pixels:
```{r squares, eval=FALSE}
make_art(art_type = "squares", inner_canvas = 500)
```
![](https://github.com/BartekSadowski/PIPS/blob/main/Pictures/example5.png?raw=true)

Last but not least, suppose that you want to generate `"patches"` on `outer_canvas` set to 1100 pixels and `inner_canvas` set to 800 pixels:
```{r patches, eval=FALSE}
make_art(art_type = "patches", outer_canvas = 1100, inner_canvas = 800)
```

## The end!

Now you know everything about `make_art()` and you can become an Rtist! Happy painting! :)
